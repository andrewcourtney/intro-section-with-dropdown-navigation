## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS with colour variables
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Building this project was a way to enhance my JavaScript coding skills and gain more experience with building interactive elements on a website. I previously felt that I lacked experience and coding knowledge within Flexbox as well, and wanted to improve this. Through the build of this project I feel that I have been able to achieve my goals.

### Continued development

My focus for future projects will be to continue to enhance my skillset in relation to JavaScript and Flexbox, but also learn more about Grid for use in other developments.
